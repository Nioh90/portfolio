                    This is a <b>full-stack web application</b> that you can use
                    to share you favourite photos, or ideas and talk about them
                    with different users. It is an
                    <b>image/gif sharing platform with social media aspects</b>
                    to it. You can <b>create your own account</b> and then
                    <b>like other people's posts</b>, as well as
                    <b>edit and delete your posts.</b>

                    Blogzoid is a fully <b>responsive website</b> which looks
                    good on mobile and desktop. It is a full-stack website which
                    uses <b>Node.js with Express</b> for the backend, which
                    includes a <b>REST API</b> from where the frontend fetches
                    data from. <b>MongoDB</b> is used as the database to store
                    data of different posts and users. There is
                    <b>JWT and OAuth Authentication</b> for the users so they
                    can securely login to their accounts and browse different
                    posts or comment on them. Finally,
                    <b>React.js with Redux</b> is used for the frontend.

                  <h1>History and Implementation</h1>
                  <p>
                    I made this project just as a personal website where I can
                    talk about my favourite games and technologies, and maybe
                    receive some feedback. It took me around 3 weeks to complete
                    this project.<br />
                    This is the biggest project I have made up until this point
                    of time and I learnt a lot of new concepts, from middleware
                    to authentication and pagination. There are a lot of
                    challenges in making a big project, the most important one
                    in my opinion is to keep track of all the various steps and
                    the data flow.

                    This is a <b>front-end REACT.js</b> based web project.
                    Stat-Tracker is a website that can track your video game
                    stats using an API provided by "tracker.gg". You need to
                    provide your <b>username and platform</b> and the website
                    will search for the query and provide you with all the stats
                    available.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This website can be used by the millions of gamers who play
                    these games to track their stats and see what they can do to
                    be better. They can figure out the places they are strong in
                    and the places they are weak and train accordingly to
                    improve their gameplay.

                    Stat-Tracker is a fully <b>responsive website</b> and it
                    scales well with mobile view as well. This website is made
                    with <b>scalability</b> in mind. It is easily scalable with
                    new data inputted in the already existing games and new
                    games added within the <b>API</b>. This website uses
                    <b>REACT Hooks</b> including
                    <b>useState, useEffect, global context, etc.</b>, along with
                    <b>React-DOM & CORS.</b> It also uses
                    <b>Bootstrap</b> components.

                  <h1>History and Implementation</h1>
                  <p>
                    Stat-Tracker is my <b>first web-application</b> after my
                    portfolio. I made this website in a week. In the beginning
                    it was really hard to progress with this website as I spent
                    a lot of time thinking about the
                    <b>design and the look of the brand.</b> Another major
                    problem was that the
                    <b
                      >API which I have used does not have a lot of
                      documentation.</b
                    >
                    I got stuck on a lot of
                    <b>CORS and proxy related issues</b> and it took me a few
                    days just to properly get the implementation of the API. In
                    this project I encountered a lot of difficulties for the
                    first time but I managed to overcome them and provide a
                    beautifully designed user-experience.
